## Heroku Deployment Issue: Lowercase Procfile

#### When deploying to Heroku, I initially created the Procfile with a lowercase "p" (procfile). This caused the deployment to fail because Heroku won't recognize it.


## Solution:

#### 1 deleted the file to procfile in the editor commited to github.

#### 2 re-created the file to Procfile commit to github.
